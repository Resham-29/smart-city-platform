### **Step 4: Add and Commit Your Files**

Now we'll save a snapshot of your project.

1.  **Add all files** (that are not being ignored) to the staging area.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
2.  **Commit the files** with a descriptive message. This creates a save point.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Initial commit of full-stack smart city dashboard"
    ```

### **Step 5: Push Your Code to GitHub**

Finally, let's upload your project.

1.  Go back to the GitHub repository page you created in Step 1. Copy the commands under the section that says **"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**.
2.  Paste those commands into your terminal and run them one by one. **Remember to replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username.**

    ```bash
    # This connects your local folder to the repository on GitHub.com
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/smart-city-platform.git

    # This renames your local branch to "main", the new standard
    git branch -M main

    # This sends your committed files up to GitHub
    git push -u origin main
